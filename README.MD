# CustomShaders in Unity
In this repository I will do my best to create a couple of nice customshaders with a little game. 

## Features
Links to bits of code:
- [Shaders](/Assets/Shaders/)
- [Script for editing shader values](Assets/Scripts/ShaderController.cs)

## Software Analysis
I will be doing this in Unity C#. 
Unity has the shader language called "ShaderLab".
ShaderLab is a node based editor.
I have however looked into alternatives, like the GLSL(OpenGL Shading Language) language. However I do not have enough experience to work with OpenGL and it would only add another obstacle.
Unreal Engine also has a node based editor, but Unity's ShaderLab is way more beginner friendly in my own opinion.

## Learning Goals
- I want to know what a shader does
- What a Surface shader is
- What a Fragment shader is
- What a Vertex shader is
- Creating custom shaders
- Changing the values of a shader using a C# script
- Applying a shader to a game

## Planning 
I will have 1 week and 3 days for each one of these portfolio exercises. 
The remaining 2 days of week #2 will be spent implementing it into my portfolio, reflecting on the process and picking/planning the next exercise.

| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | picking and setting up| creating the base, a simple customshader | making it more complex | making it customizable within the editor | make it run smooth | 
|week 2 | add another shader | let others test it/check out the sourcecode | polish/clean up code bits  | adding it to my portfolio | reflection  |
