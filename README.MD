# CustomShaders in Unity
In this repository I will do my best to create a couple of nice customshaders. 

### Readme is Work In Progress/Incomplete

## Features
Links to bits of code:
- [Shader]()

## Software Analysis
Unity makes use of shaders.

## Learning Goals
- I want to understand shaders

## Planning 
I will have 1 week and 3 days for each one of these portfolio exercises. 
The remaining 2 days of week #2 will be spent implementing it into my portfolio, reflecting on the process and picking/planning the next exercise.

| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | picking and setting up| creating the base, a simple customshader | making it more complex | making it customizable within the editor | make it run smooth | 
|week 2 | add another shader | let others test it/check out the sourcecode | polish/clean up code bits  | adding it to my portfolio | reflection  | 

## Sources
Here I will link the sources I have made use of.
